/**
	Euler published the remarkable quadratic formula:
	
	n + n + 41
	
	It turns out that the formula will produce 40 primes for the consecutive
	values n = 0 to 39. However, when n = 40, 402 + 40 + 41 = 40(40 + 1) + 41
	is divisible by 41, and certainly when n = 41, 41 + 41 + 41 is clearly
	divisible by 41.
	
	Using computers, the incredible formula  n - 79n + 1601 was discovered,
	which produces 80 primes for the consecutive values n = 0 to 79.
	The product of the coefficients, -79 and 1601, is 126479.
	
	Considering quadratics of the form:
	
		n + an + b, where |a| < 1000 and |b| < 1000
	
		where |n| is the modulus/absolute value of n
		e.g. |11| = 11 and |-4| = 4
		
	Find the product of the coefficients, a and b, for the quadratic
	expression that produces the maximum number of primes for consecutive
	values of n, starting with n = 0.
